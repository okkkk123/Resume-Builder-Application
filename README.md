# Resume Builder

This web application built with Javascript and React.js library generates a professional resume from user entered information, streamlining the process and ensuring relevant content is efficiently formatted. 

## Description
This application contains various forms that allow a user to input their information. There are 4 forms in this application each asking different sets of information. 
1. **General Information:** User's Name, Email, Phone Number
2. **Educational Information:** User's School, Degree/Program of Study, Study Period (Start - End)
3. **Practical Information:** User's previous/current company, Position, Tasks performed, Work Period (Start - End)
4. **Skills Information:** Allows users to add a minimum of 4 skills to maximum of 10 skills 

I chose React.js for this application because it allows me to build each form (General Info, Educational Info, Work Experience, and Skills) as a separate component, ensuring clean, reusable, and maintainable code. React's component-based architecture simplifies managing the state and props across the application, making it easy to handle user inputs, validation, and dynamic rendering of the resume. Additionally, Reactâ€™s efficiency in updating the UI with minimal DOM manipulation enhances the overall user experience.

## Why I built this Application
1. To further improve my react skills
2. Understand how and when to use state variables
3. Learn how to build forms and implement form validation
4. Learn how to build React Components 

## Challenges Faced
Firstly I had a tough time with updating the state using array and object state variables. To tackle this I used Mozilla's MDN Web Docs and React.dev/learn to understand documenation and usage purposes.
