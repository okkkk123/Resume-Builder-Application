# Resume Builder

This web application built with Javascript and React.js library generates a professional resume from user entered information, streamlining the process and ensuring relevant content is efficiently formatted. 

## Description
This application contains various forms that allow a user to input their information. There are 4 forms in this application each asking different sets of information. 
1.) General Information: User's Name, Email, Phone Number
2.) Educational Information: User's School, Degree/Program of Study, Start date and End date for Study period
3.) Practical Information: User's previous/current company, position, tasks at said position, dates for Start and end date at each company
4.) Skills Information: Allows users to add a minimum of 4 skills to maximum of 10 skills 

I chose React.js for this application because it allows me to build each form (General Info, Educational Info, Work Experience, and Skills) as a separate component, ensuring clean, reusable, and maintainable code. React's component-based architecture simplifies managing the state and props across the application, making it easy to handle user inputs, validation, and dynamic rendering of the resume. Additionally, Reactâ€™s efficiency in updating the UI with minimal DOM manipulation enhances the overall user experience.

## Challenges Faced
Firstly I had a tough time with updating the state using array and object state variables. To tackle this I used Mozilla's MDN Web Docs and React.dev/learn to understand documenation and usage purposes.
